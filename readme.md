JavaScript Learning Journey ðŸš€
Hey! my name is Atif Zafar and welcome to my JavaScript Learning Journey! This repository is where I document my daily progress as I learn and practice JavaScript. Each folder represents a day's worth of learning, including:

HTML and JS files containing code snippets and exercises I completed.
PDF notes summarizing the key concepts Iâ€™ve studied for the day.
Feel free to follow along, explore the files, and learn with me!

ðŸŒ± Why I Started This Repo:
Iâ€™m learning JavaScript with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer. This repo is my way of tracking progress and sharing my journey with others. By documenting everything from day one, I aim to:

Build accountability for myself.
Share knowledge with others who are starting their web development journey.
Learn in public and connect with fellow developers.
